# i18n

Almost every project nowadays needs translations.

This module provides server-side translations that compliments [translations in the UI](https://github.com/codeborne/i18n-json/).

**i18n** directory with json translations must be added to classpath, see [sample project](../sample/build.gradle.kts)
